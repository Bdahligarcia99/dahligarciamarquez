# Storage Driver Implementation Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

The storage driver abstraction has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Interface**: `server/src/storage/driver.ts` - Defines `StorageDriver` interface with `putImage()` and `health()` methods
- **Local Driver**: `server/src/storage/localDriver.ts` - File system storage with date-based organization 
- **Supabase Driver**: `server/src/storage/supabaseDriver.ts` - Supabase Storage integration with service-role key
- **Factory**: `server/src/storage/index.ts` - Driver selection based on `STORAGE_DRIVER` environment variable

### 🔌 Integration
- **Upload Route**: Updated `/api/images/uploads/image` to use storage driver abstraction
- **Health Endpoint**: Added `GET /api/storage/health` for driver status monitoring
- **Server Startup**: Added storage driver logging on boot
- **Static Serving**: Existing `/uploads` static file serving maintained for local storage

### 🧪 Testing
- Basic storage functionality tests in `server/__tests__/storage.test.js`
- Validates driver selection, mime types, file size limits, and path generation

### 📝 Environment Variables
Updated `server/env.example` with new configuration options:
```bash
# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_DRIVER=local                    # 'local' | 'supabase'
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=             # Server-only key for Supabase Storage
SUPABASE_BUCKET=public-images          # Bucket name for Supabase Storage
```

## Acceptance Checklist ✅

### ✅ 🗄️ Storage driver logging appears on boot
- Local: `🗄️ Storage driver: local`
- Supabase: `🗄️ Storage driver: supabase (bucket-name)`

### ✅ `/api/storage/health` reports driver status
- Returns `{ ok: boolean, driver: string, details?: string }`
- Performs actual health checks (directory access for local, bucket verification for Supabase)

### ✅ `/api/images/uploads/image` works with local storage
- Saves files to `server/uploads/yyyy/mm/dd/` structure
- Returns URLs like `/uploads/2024/01/15/uuid-filename.ext`
- Maintains existing admin authentication

### ✅ Supabase Storage integration ready
- When `STORAGE_DRIVER=supabase` and environment is configured
- Returns public Supabase URLs: `https://project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/bucket/path`
- Auto-creates bucket if missing (with fallback guidance)

### ✅ Clear error responses
- **503**: `{ error: 'Uploads not configured' }` for missing Supabase config
- **413**: `{ error: 'File too large. Maximum size: 5MB' }` for oversized files  
- **415**: `{ error: 'Unsupported media type. Allowed: image/png, image/jpg...' }` for invalid types
- No server crashes, proper error handling throughout

### 🔒 Security Features
- Service-role key properly secured (server-only, redacted in logs)
- File validation (mime type, size limits)
- Filename sanitization and path normalization
- No client-side Supabase dependencies required

### 📊 File Organization
- **Local**: Date-based directory structure (`yyyy/mm/dd`)
- **Supabase**: Same path structure in bucket
- UUID-based filenames with optional original name hints
- Proper file extension mapping from mime types

## Usage

### Development (Local Storage)
```bash
STORAGE_DRIVER=local
```
Files saved to `server/uploads/`, served via `/uploads/` static route.

### Production (Supabase Storage)  
```bash
STORAGE_DRIVER=supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_BUCKET=public-images
```
Files uploaded to Supabase Storage, public URLs returned.

## Client Compatibility ✅
- **No client code changes required**
- Upload endpoint `/api/images/uploads/image` unchanged
- Error handling for 503/413/415 already implemented
- URLs work transparently (local `/uploads/...` or Supabase `https://...`)

The storage driver abstraction is production-ready and maintains full backward compatibility while providing flexible storage options.
