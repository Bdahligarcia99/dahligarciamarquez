# Git Workflow

## Branch Rules

- **Always push to `dev` branch** - All commits should be pushed to the `dev` branch
- Do NOT push directly to `main` unless explicitly requested
- The `dev` branch is the active development branch
- `main` and `dev` should be kept in sync periodically by the user

## Commit Guidelines

- Create checkpoint commits frequently during editing sessions
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain "why" not just "what"
- Commit before making major changes to provide restore points
