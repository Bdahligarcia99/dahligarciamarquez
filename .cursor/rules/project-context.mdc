# Project Context: Website (dahligarciamarquez)

This is the **personal website/blog project**.

## Wrong Project Detection

If the user asks about any of the following topics, they are likely in the wrong Cursor window:

- PoseMaster
- Pose Master
- gesture practice
- gesture-practice
- pose references
- drawing practice app
- figure drawing
- gesture drawing
- pose timer
- Tauri (unless specifically about this project)
- installer/packaging for a desktop app

**When detected**: Politely remind the user:
> "It looks like you're asking about PoseMaster, but we're currently in the website project window. Would you like to switch to the PoseMaster workspace?"

Then wait for confirmation before proceeding.
