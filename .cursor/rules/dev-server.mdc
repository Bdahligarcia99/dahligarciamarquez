# Dev Server Rule

**Do NOT start the development server** (e.g., `npm run dev`, `npm start`, `vite`, etc.) unless the user explicitly asks for it.

When making code changes:
- Edit files as needed
- Run tests if requested
- Check for linter errors
- But do NOT automatically start or restart the dev server

Only start the dev server when the user says something like:
- "Start the dev server"
- "Run the app"
- "Start the server"
- "npm run dev"
